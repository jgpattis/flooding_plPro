In a flooding simulation high concentrations of ligand are placed in a simulation box to encourage rapid binding.   

The simulaton_setup directory contains files to set up flooding simulations and input files to re-run our flooding simulations of plpro   

The analysis directory contains the analysis of the flooding simulations for our paper
